# blender-image-operators
Single-operator add-ons in the style of image processing filters for the image editor of Blender

## Guidelines for contributing
Script files located in 'Curated Addons' will contain the required logic to correctly append an image processing operator to the 'Filters'-menu.
The operator must be callable from Python (without context variables).
